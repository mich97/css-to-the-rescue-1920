        <p class="description-1">
            The son of Emperor Yomei, Prince Shotoku (574-622) was a semi-legendary regent of the Asuka Period (592-710). He
            is credited with resuming contact with China and embracing Confucianism and Buddhism. Shotoku invited three
            carpenters from Baekje, a large kingdom encompassing the southwestern part of the Korean peninsula, to oversee
            the construction of Shitenno-ji (四天王寺), the first Buddhist temple in Japan, which began construction in 593 in
            what’s now south-central Osaka.

        <h3 class="title-2">World's first novel</h3>
        <p class="description-2">
            Completed around the year 1010, The Tale of Genji (源氏物語・Genji Monogatari) is generally considered to be the
            world’s first novel. It was written by a woman going by the pen name Murasaki Shikibu (c. 978-1014), though her
            real name is unknown. Born into a lesser branch of the powerful Fujiwara Clan, she served Empress Joto-mon’in in
            the court of Emperor Ichijo.
